| Script | What it does |
| ------ | ------------ |
| 0-run | This Shell script that runs a Python script.<br><br>The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE |
| 1-run_inline | This Shell script that runs Python code.<br><br>The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE |
| 2-print.py |  |
| 3-print_number.py |  |
| 4-print_float.py |  |
| 5-print_string.py |  |
| 6-concat.py |  |
| 7-edges.py |  |
| 8-concat_edges.py |  |
| 9-easter_egg.py |  |
| 10-check_cycle.c, lists.h | Technical interview preparation:<br><br>You are not allowed to google anything<br>Whiteboard first<br>This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solutionâ€™s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.<br><br>Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.<br><br>* Prototype: `int check_cycle(listint_t *list)`;<br>* Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle.<br><br>Requirements:<br><br>Only these functions are allowed: `write`, `printf`, `putchar`, `puts`, `malloc`, `free`. |
| 100-write.py | A Python script that prints exactly and `that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line.<br><br>* Use the function write from the sys module.<br>* You are not allowed to use print.<br>* Your script should print to stderr.<br>* Your script should exit with the status code 1. |
| 101-compile | A script that compiles a Python script file.<br><br>The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable $PYFILE<br><br>The output filename has to be $PYFILEc (ex: export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc) |
| 102-magic_calculation.py | Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b):` that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode: <pre>3           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (98)<br>            3 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)<br>            6 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)<br>            9 BINARY_POWER<br>            10 BINARY_ADD<br>            11 RETURN_VALUE </pre> |
